# Latex code for Thesis

This aim of this project is to help students writing a bachelor's thesis or master's thesis while using the typesetting program LaTeX. 

Hands-on material in the form of code sequences is provided in this depository.

The following often-occurring problems faced while using LaTeX were made publicly available:
  - Setting up a functioning mainframe to be able to work with (Thesis-Main.tex)
  - How to format tables and figures automatically according to American Psychological Association (APA) 6th Style (APA 6th formatting.tex)
  - Adding a list of tables and list of figures to table of content (Add List of Tables and List of Figures.tex)
  - Setting up a horizontal table (Horizontal table.tex)
  - Setting up a vertical table (Sideways table.tex)
  - Creating a multipage (Multipage.tex)
  
 The coding was used for writing a master's thesis, but may be used for any other type of thesis (bachelor thesis, essay etc.) as well.
 
 All code sequences were complied with Texmaker 5.0.4 (http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) as of the year 2020 and can be used freely.
